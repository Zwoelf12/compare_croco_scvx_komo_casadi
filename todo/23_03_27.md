# TODO
## Code
- plot resulting jacobians
- double check again that we are doing everything right with dynamics in KOMO

## Writing
- ask Quim to proof read the first few paragraphs (Introduction could be a bit spicier) 
- add 4th scenario
- write abstract

# IN PROGRESS
## Code
- add Gurobi License

## Writing

# DONE
## Code
- install gurobi on workstation
- make 4th scenario work with komo scvx and casadi

## Writing
- make plots for scenario descriptions more beautiful
  - change the number of plottet quadcopters for scenario 3 (plot especially configurations in the beginning)
  - for scenario 3 the axis labeling is cut off
- make the subfigures IEEE conform (https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/305472/how-to-insert-subfigure-with-caption-in-ieee-trans/305492#305492)
- cite cvxpy https://www.cvxpy.org/citing/index.html

# DISCUSSION
- why for KOMO timing desired step+1?

# BACKLOG
- clean up forked repo mess
- things to improve casadi
  - include scaling
  - tune ipopt
  - generate c code for dynamic functions?
    - try to use generated c code by implementing an ode object in casadi
