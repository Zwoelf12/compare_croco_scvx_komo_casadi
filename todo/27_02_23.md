# TODO
## Code
- modify visualization for multiple trials
- plot resulting jacobians
- improve flip through window scenario

## Writing
- write scenario descriptions
- ask Quim to proof read the first few paragraphs (Introduction could be a bit spicier) 

# IN PROGRESS
- set up repositiory on the workstation to run tests smoothly

# DONE
## Code
- make sphere scenario work with casadi
- modify visualization for one trial
- make recovery scenario work with casadi
- make tune algorithms file
- implement flip through window scenario
- include intermediate points in initial guess
- check c code generation to speed up casadi
  - it seems like casadis own function objects can not be used for defining constraints 
- make komo and scvx handle intermediate points

## Writing
- set up paper document
- write introduction
- include citations for introduction 
- write model section
- write problem description
- write scp part
- write komo part

# DISCUSSION
- other rotor numbers than 4? -> performance did not differ so much between komo and scvx, not interesting for comparision of different methods? (probably more interesting when looking at different dynamic capabilities of systems with different rotor numbers)

# BACKLOG
- clean up forked repo mess
- things to improve casadi
  - include scaling
  - tune ipopt
  - generate c code for dynamic functions?
    - try to use generated c code by implementing a ode object in casadi
