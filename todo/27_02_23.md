# TODO
## Code
- modify visualization for multiple trials
- set up repositiory on the workstation to run tests smoothly
- plot resulting jacobians
- improve flip through window scenario

## Writing
- write model section
- write problem description

# IN PROGRESS
- include citations for introduction 

# DONE
## Code
- make sphere scenario work with casadi
- modify visualization for one trial
- make recovery scenario work with casadi
- make tune algorithms file
- implement flip through window scenario
- include intermediate points in initial guess
- check c code generation to speed up casadi
  - it seems like casadis own function objects can not be used for defining constraints 
- make komo and scvx handle intermediate points

## Writing
- set up paper document
- write introduction

# DISCUSSION

# BACKLOG
- clean up forked repo mess
- things to improve casadi
  - include scaling
  - tune ipopt
  - generate c code for dynamic functions?
