# TODO
## Code
- plot resulting jacobians
- double check again that we are doing everything right with dynamics in KOMO
- decrease the constraint violation threshold for KOMO
- add the number of iterations

## Writing
- write abstract
- make clear what are the optimization variables and constraints for each method
- make plots single plots not directly subfigures
- check who is writing the introduction to KOMO

# IN PROGRESS
## Code

## Writing

# DONE
## Code

## Writing
- double check model description
- describe ECOS instead of gurobi

# DISCUSSION
- why for KOMO timing desired step+1?

# BACKLOG
- clean up forked repo mess
- things to improve casadi
  - include scaling
  - tune ipopt
  - generate c code for dynamic functions?
    - try to use generated c code by implementing an ode object in casadi
