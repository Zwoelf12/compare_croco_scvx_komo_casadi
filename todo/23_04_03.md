# TODO
## Code
- double check again that we are doing everything right with dynamics in KOMO
- check why marc is evaluating the hessian in the linesearch again
- make sure visualization subprocesses are terminating

## Writing
- discuss relation between solver time and hessian evaluations with Quim
- could we get rid of the two equations for torgue and force?
- change the description of the initial guess
- update success rates


# IN PROGRESS
## Code
- run all trials

## Writing


# DONE
## Code
- add number of iterations
  - KOMO
    - add number of newton iterations
    - add number of hessian evaluations
  - SCVX
    - scvx iterations
    - number of hessian evals (equals number of convex iterations)
  - IPOPT
    - add number of interiorpoint solver iterations
    - add number of hessian evals (equal to number of interior point solver iterations)

- decrease the constraint violation threshold for KOMO
- add the number of iterations
- rerun experiments
- plot hessians
- send Quim a view failing initial guesses
- run croco trials
- run croco with different initial guess
- change integration scheme with casadi to euler?
  - does not really work 
  


## Writing
- double check model description
- describe ECOS instead of gurobi
- make plots single plots not directly subfigures
- discuss with Quim whether newton evals are function evaluations or Hessian evals
- make clear what are the optimization variables and constraints for each method
- change affiliation
- describe different discretization schemes for scvx and casadi and komo
- write abstract
- change the solver names in figures
- change color scheme for the four solvers
- make the plot text bigger
- check who is writing the introduction to Croco

# DISCUSSION
- what about hessian evaluations:
  - number of hessian evaluations for IPopt
    - ipopt uses a log barrier method to approximate a solution fulfilling the KKT conditions
    - as unconstrained solver is damped newton used
    - damped newton uses the hessian to compute step  
    - why is number of lagrangian hessian evaluations equal to number of iterations
  - number of hessian evaluations for KOMO
    - KOMO uses AuLa to calculate a solution fulfilling the KKT conditions
    - uses newton as unconstrained solver as well
    - newton uses hessian to compute steps
    - number of hessian evaluations is not equal to number of newton iterations
  - number of hessian evaluations for SCVX
    - SCVX approximates the nonlinear optimization problem as convex in each iteration and solves convex subproblem with ECOS
    - ECOS uses barrier method to solve the constrained optimization problem
    - unconstrained problem is solved by Newtons Method 
    - newtons method calculates step direction by solving Hh = -g (doesnt really look like the Hessian more like the KKT System put in equations) 2 times (affine direction and combined directions)?

# BACKLOG
- clean up forked repo mess
- things to improve casadi
  - include scaling
  - tune ipopt
  - generate c code for dynamic functions?
    - try to use generated c code by implementing an ode object in casadi
